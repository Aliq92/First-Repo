# **Aya Tools — AI Prompt Library**

A living vault of prompts, systems, and creative tools built by **Awangku Murhaliq (Aya)**.  
This repository collects the workflows, signals, and prompt structures that power my work across design, branding, study, automation, and personal mastery.

Everything here is built with intention:
- **Clarity over chaos**  
- **Speed over perfection**  
- **Consistency over luck**

This repo keeps my tools in one place so I can move fast, build clean, and create with discipline.
