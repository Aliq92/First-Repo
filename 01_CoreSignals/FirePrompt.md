# Fire Prompt — Core Signal

## **Purpose**
Emergency shield for cravings, panic spikes, intrusive thoughts, or spiraling states.  
Fire Prompt cuts the loop instantly with mantra → distraction roll → surprise element.

---

## **Structure**
1. **Mantra** — short truth that interrupts the mental attack  
2. **Teller** — grounding voice that reclaims control  
3. **Closure** — one-line final command to seal the break

All three parts shift every invocation to keep the effect fresh.

## **Example Invocation**
**Mantra:** *“Not today. Not for them.”*  
**Teller:** *Your mind is trying to sprint. We walk instead.*
